  Hi, I'm the official OrangeFox Recovery bot (<code>{version}</code>), here is what I can do for you:
  - /list: This shows you a list of supported devices.
  - <code>/(codename)</code>: Get the latest stable build info and download links, for example: /lavender
  - <code>/(OEM)</code>: This will show you all devices from that OEM, that have stable releases, for example: /Xiaomi.

  - Supports non-OrangeFox chats, add me to your chats and type /start to get help.
